== Raspberry Pi Experimental OS

This project is about learning about operating systems by writing one
for the RaspberryPi.

So far I'm working with QEMU and emulating the RaspberryPi because
the RasberryPi hasn't been released.

A development log is contained in the files NOTES in the root
directory.

== Resources

Here is a list some sites containing useful information

  (Raspberry Pi): http://www.raspberrypi.org/
  (QEMU, Compiler, Linux): http://raspi.springnote.com/pages/8234984
  (LambdaPi): https://gitorious.org/lambdapi
  (eLinux Wiki): http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiBoard

== Setting up a development environment

This sets up a development environment under Debian. I run Debian
inside Virtualbox on my windows machine.

First inspect the bootstrap.sh script, particularly the installation
directory defined at the top

  emacs bootstrap.sh

Next run the bootstrap script

  bash bootstrap.sh

This will build a recent version of QEMU and install the GNU C
toolchain for ARM

== Building the Project

Inspect the rake file to make sure the directory where the tools were
installed in the previous step are correct

  emacs Rakefile

Next run

  rake run

This will build the kernel and run qemu.

== Where to next?

There is a more detailed development log contained in the file NOTES
in the root directory.
